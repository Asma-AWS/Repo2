Ever looked out of an airplane window and wished you were out there, among the clouds, enjoying the gentle breeze and the stunning view? \n\n Sky Dine is one of the most unusual dining experiences in the world. You have probably dined at a rooftop restaurant, but thatâ€™s far from the exhilaration that awaits up there-and by up there we mean 150 feet above the ground, where crane will hoist your dining set. \n\n The beauty of the experience neutralizes any kind of fear. The whole mechanism follows the safety standards enforced by German engineering and safety experts. There are safety seatbelts to buckle you securely, and the chef and crew are secured by safety harnesses. Sky Dining brings you this unique sensation, along with some scrumptious food, right here in your city! Opening shortly in all major cities like Hyderabad, Kolkata, Bangalore, New Delhi and Mumbai, we promise you that this restaurant will take your breath away!'
